# Contributing guidelines
Thank you for contributing to the C-json json parsing library! In this short file I will give a quick guide on how to contribute to this project.

## Issues
If you have spotted an issue in the source code, check if there is already an open issue about it in the issues section; if not you can open an issue yourself to shed light on the problem.


If you think you have a solution to an open issue, dont hesitate to present your solution; I am highly thankful for all the contributions to the project.
